Hello!
#OVERVIEW_OF_LYRICAL

In this project, I created a react app with express backend.I used an api called GENIUS API to get all music data and used its website to scrape the lyrics using cheerio.This is clearly an non-profit web app for education purpose only.In order to run the project download it and open with any code editor(my preference is Visual Studio)
Then run the below command in sequence.

1. npm install                 // Install dependencies for REACT
2. cd backend && npm install   // Go to backend folder and install dependencies
3. npm start                   // run REACT 
3. cd backend && npm start     // go to backend folder and run NODE 

 Before you test this out make sure to change the mongoURI and secret in backend/config/keys.js file.
 
 In this project,
 
 For Node i have used dependencies :
 1. cors                       // to allow communicartion betweeen client and server
 2. nodemon                    // helps to automatically restart node after changing some program and saving it
 3. cheerio                    // to scrape the web. In lamen's term to extract only lyrics from the given website.
 4. axios                      // to communicate with genius api
  
In REACT, I used MaterialUI for building components, Redux for state management and Axios to fetch data from our NODE server.

This project use more complex redux concepts then my previous project <a href="https://github.com/santos-parajuli/MERN_Authentication" >MERN AUTHENTICATION</a> and i used more of class based components for react. 

I will also be deploying this project live on my website www.siwani.com.np so you can check it out there.
I am also woring on my portfolio app. Very excited for learing UI using material-UI. 
HAPPY HACKING !!!
SEE YOU SOON <3
